        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer and the creator of the Linux kernel, which is the core component of the Linux operating system. He was born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland. Torvalds started developing the Linux kernel in 1991 while he was a student at the University of Helsinki. He released the initial version of the kernel to the public and continued to work on its development, collaborating with other developers around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds is also known for his role as the maintainer of the Linux kernel, overseeing its development and making decisions about which contributions to accept into the official kernel source tree. He has been involved in various open-source and software development communities and is considered one of the most influential figures in the world of free and open-source software.

        <h3>Personal life</h3>
        Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (n√©e Monni), a six-time Finnish national karate champion, whom he met in late 1993. He was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date. They were later married and have three daughters, two of whom were born in the United States. The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) as magic values.

        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>The first Linux prototypes were publicly released in late 1991. Version 1.0 was released on 14 March 1994.</p>
        <p>Torvalds first encountered the GNU Project in fall of 1991 when another Swedish-speaking computer science student, Lars Wirzenius, took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software guru Richard Stallman's speech. Torvalds would ultimately switch his original license (which forbade commercial use) to Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) for his Linux kernel after complaints of distributors being unable to recoup their costs due to a non-commercial clause.</p>

        <h3>Other software</h3>
        <h4>Git</h4>
        <p>On 3 April 2005, Torvalds began development on Git, version control software that later became widely used. On 26 July 2005, he turned over Git's maintenance to Junio Hamano, a major project contributor.</p>
        <h4>Subsurface</h4>
        <p>Subsurface is software for logging and planning scuba dives, which Torvalds began developing in late 2011. It is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. Dirk Hohndel became its head maintainer in late 2012.</p>
